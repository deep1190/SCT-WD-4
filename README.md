# To-Do List Application
This repository contains a simple and efficient To-Do List application that I developed. The application helps users organize their tasks by allowing them to add, edit, and delete tasks with ease.

Project Overview
The To-Do List application was created to practice and demonstrate skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It provides a clean and intuitive interface for managing daily tasks, helping users stay productive and organized.

Key Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their list quickly.
Edit Tasks: Tasks can be edited to update or correct any details.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list once they are completed or no longer needed.
Mark as Complete: Tasks can be marked as completed, and they will be visually distinguished.
Persistent Storage: The application uses local storage to save tasks, ensuring they persist even after the browser is closed.
Responsive Design: The interface is responsive, making it usable on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the application.
CSS3: For styling the interface and ensuring a responsive layout.
JavaScript: For implementing the core functionality, including task management and local storage handling.
